Code signing on iOS requires enrolling to the [Apple Developer] program.

To distribute iOS applications you must have your bundle identifier registered in the App Store Connect,
an appropriate iOS code signing certificate and a mobile provisioning profile that links them together and enables the iOS capabilities used by your app.
These requirements can be either automatically managed by Xcode or provided manually.

### Automatic Signing

Letting Xcode manage the signing and provisioning for your app is the most convenient way to export your iOS app to be distributed.
It automatically registers your bundle identifier, manages iOS capabilities changes, and configures an appropriate certificate based on your export method.

Automatic signing is enabled by default, and uses the account configured in Xcode to authenticate when used on your local machine.\
To register your account, open the Xcode application and open the Settings page in the `Xcode > Settings` menu, switch to the Accounts tab and click the `+` icon.

To use the automatic signing in CI/CD platforms you must create an App Store Connect API key
and define the `APPLE_API_ISSUER`, `APPLE_API_KEY` and `APPLE_API_KEY_PATH` environment variables.\
Open the [App Store Connect's Users and Access page], select the Keys tab, click on the Add button and select a name and the Developer access.
The APPLE_API_ISSUER (Issuer ID) is presented above the keys table, and the APPLE_API_KEY is the value on the Key ID column on that table.
You also need to download the private key, which can only be done once and is only visible after a page reload (the button is shown on the table row for the newly created key).
The private key file path must be set via the APPLE_API_KEY_PATH environment variable.

### Manual Signing

To manually sign your iOS app you can provide the certificate and mobile provisioning profile via environment variables.

## Signing Certificate

After enrolling, navigate to the [Certificates] page to create a new Apple Distribution certificate.
Download the new certificate and install it to the macOS Keychain.

To export the certificate key, open the "Keychain Access" app, expand the certificate's entry, right-click on the key item and select "Export \<key-name\>" item.
Select the path of the exported .p12 file and remember its password.
Run `base64 -i <path-to-certificate.p12> | pbcopy` to convert the certificate to base64 and copy it to the clipboard, and paste that value to the `IOS_CERTIFICATE` environment variable.
The certificate password must be set to the `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` variable.

:::note
You must use an appropriate certificate type for each export method:

- debugging: Apple Development or iOS App Development
- app-store-connect: Apple Distribution or iOS Distribution (App Store Connect and Ad Hoc)
- ad-hoc: Apple Distribution or iOS Distribution (App Store Connect and Ad Hoc)

## Provisioning Profile

Additionally, you must provide the provisioning profile for your application. In the [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) page, create a new App ID and make sure its "Bundle ID" value matches the identifier set in the [`identifier`] configuration.

Navigate to the [Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list) page to create a new provisioning profile. For App Store distribution, it must be an "App Store Connect" profile. Select the appropriate App ID and link the certificate you previously created.

After creating the provisioning profile, download it and run `base64 -i <path-to-profile.mobileprovision> | pbcopy` to convert the profile to base64 and copy it to the clipboard, and paste that value to the `IOS_MOBILE_PROVISION` environment variable.

Now you can build your iOS application and distribute on the App Store!
