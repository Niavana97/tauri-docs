Code signing on iOS requires enrolling to the [Apple Developer] program.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

The easiest way to sign your iOS bundle for distribution on CI systems is to manually provide the certificate and mobile provisioning profile.

## Signing Certificate

After enrolling, navigate to the [Certificates] page to create a new Apple Distribution certificate.
Download the new certificate and install it to the macOS Keychain.

To export the certificate key, open the "Keychain Access" app, expand the certificate's entry, right-click on the key item and select "Export \<key-name\>" item.
Select the path of the exported .p12 file and remember its password.
Run `base64 -i <path-to-certificate.p12> | pbcopy` to convert the certificate to base64 and copy it to the clipboard, and paste that value to the `IOS_CERTIFICATE` environment variable.
The certificate password must be set to the `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` variable.

## Provisioning Profile

Additionally, you must provide the provisioning profile for your application. In the [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) page, create a new App ID and make sure its "Bundle ID" value matches the identifier set in the [`identifier`] configuration.

Navigate to the [Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list) page to create a new provisioning profile. For App Store distribution, it must be an "App Store Connect" profile. Select the appropriate App ID and link the certificate you previously created.

After creating the provisioning profile, download it and run `base64 -i <path-to-profile.mobileprovision> | pbcopy` to convert the profile to base64 and copy it to the clipboard, and paste that value to the `IOS_MOBILE_PROVISION` environment variable.

Now you can build your iOS application and distribute on the App Store!
