Code signing on macOS requires enrolling to the [Apple Developer] program.

## Signing Certificate

After enrolling, navigate to the [Certificates] page to create a new Developer ID Application (to share your app outside the App Store)
or an Apple Distribution (for App Store distribution) certificate. Download the new certificate and install it to the macOS Keychain.

To export the certificate key, open the "Keychain Access" app, expand the certificate's entry, right-click on the key item and select "Export \<key-name\>" item.
Select the path of the exported .p12 file and remember its password.
Run `base64 -i <path-to-certificate.p12> | pbcopy` to convert the certificate to base64 and copy it to the clipboard, and paste that value to the `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` environment variable.
The certificate password must be set to the `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` variable.

## Notarization

To notarize your application, you must provide credentials for Tauri to authenticate with Apple:

- APPLE_API_ISSUER, APPLE_API_KEY and APPLE_API_KEY_PATH: authenticate using an App Store Connect API key

  Open the [App Store Connect's Users and Access page], select the Keys tab, click on the Add button and select a name and the Developer access.
  The APPLE_API_ISSUER (Issuer ID) is presented above the keys table, and the APPLE_API_KEY is the value on the Key ID column on that table.
  You also need to download the private key, which can only be done once and is only visible after a page reload (the button is shown on the table row for the newly created key).
  The private key file path must be set via the APPLE_API_KEY_PATH environment variable.

- APPLE_ID, APPLE_PASSWORD and APPLE_TEAM_ID: authenticate using your Apple ID

  Alternatively, to authenticate with your Apple ID, set the APPLE_ID to your Apple account email and the APPLE_PASSWORD to an app-specific password for the Apple account.

:::note
Notarization is required when using a Developer ID Application certificate.
